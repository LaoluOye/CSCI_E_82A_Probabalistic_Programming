    "In the practice homework, you computed the posterior probabilities of either the cook (C), the butler (B), being a murderer given the choice of weapons (K = knife, P = poison). In this exercise you will construct a Directed Bayesian Graphical Model or belief network for the available evidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a cliche that a criminal must have opportunity, $OP$, means, $W$, and a motive, $MO$:   \n",
    "- Since both the cook and butler were at the house and had access to the victim when the murder was committed, we can say that $P(OP) = 1.0$. Any model can be simplified by eliminating this variable.  \n",
    "- The Inspector has already established that the means was either a knife, $K$, or poison, $P$.    \n",
    "- Upon questioning the suspects, Inspector Markov believe that inheriting part of the fortune of the victim is a likely motive. She suspects that the butler may be due an inheritance, but doubts the cook does. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, as Inspector Markov has continued her investigation she has discovered an unexplained set of footprints, evidence that a third person may have been involved in the crime. There is no evidence linking the cook or the butler to any other possible perpetrator, the model can neglect the possibility of collaboration with a third party. In other words, $p(C,B\\ |\\ third\\ party) = 0$, $p(third\\ party\\ |\\ cook = 0)$, and $p(third\\ party\\ |\\ butler = 0)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also continue to assume that the butler and the cook did not influence each other to commit the crime. Therefore, $p(B\\ |\\ C) = p(B)$ and $p(C\\ |\\ B) = p(C)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step in creating the belief network, import the packages you will need for this analysis."
