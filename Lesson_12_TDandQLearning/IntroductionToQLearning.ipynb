    "In the previous lesson we explored Monte Carlo **reinforcement learning**. MC RL required that the returns for an entire episode be computed before any values are available for use. The disadvantage of this approach is the the full set of returns are required for state value or action value estimates. But, how can we get state values or action-values in fewer time steps? It turns out there are algorithms which compute estimates in as few as one step known as **time difference learning** or **TD-learning** and **Q-learning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that reinforcement learning has several distinctive characteristics, which differentiate this method from other machine learning and dynamic programming:\n",
    "- **No Markov model** needs to be specified for reinforcement learning, in contrast to dynamic programming.\n",
    "- Like dynamic programming, reinforcement learning **optimizes a reward function**. This is in contrast to supervised and unsupervised learning which use an error or objective function.  \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by **experience**. Over time, the algorithm learns a model of the environment and these results are used to optimize the expected reward. Learning from experience is in contrast to supervised learning which uses known marked cases. \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning agents take **actions** and only receive **state** and **rewards** from the environment. These are the only interaction between the RL agent and the environment.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between a reinforcement learning agent and the environment are illustrated in the figure below. Notice that the only feedback the agent receives from the environment is reward and state.   \n",

    "The ability to learn from experience is an attractive concept. This method of learning seems to mimic human learning. However, reinforcement learning has proven difficult to use in real-world applications. For a review of successes and problems arising when applying RL to robotics see [Kobler et. al.](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Kober_IJRR_2013.pdf). At the present time, RL has mostly succeeded in cases where simulations can be used to gain experience. \n",

    "## On Policy vs. Off Policy Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will explore examples of two broad categories of RL algorithms known as **on policy** and **off policy** methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "On policy methods evaluate and improve a single policy. On policy methods converge quickly and often to good solution. In general, **exploration** is performed using $\\epsilon$-greedy methods. The TD(0) and MC algorithms we have examined are examples of on policy methods. On policy algorithms are known to have good convergence properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, off policy methods use two policies. The policy the agent is following is called the **behavior policy**, denoted $b(A_t | S_t)$. The policy being improved is known as the **target policy**, denoted $\\pi (A_t | S_t)$. The agent obtains samples of the environment while following the behavior policy. These samples are used to improve the target policy. An advantage of off policy methods is that a deterministic behavior policy can be used while a better target policy is developed. "

    "## Example of Time Difference RL\n",
    "\n",
    "With this short introduction TD RL in mind, let's try an example. We will sample the value function using a basic TD(0) algorithm here. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in other labs, **Navigation** to a goal is a significant problem in robotics. Real-world navigation is rather complex. Therefore, in this example we will use a simple analog called a **grid world**. The grid world for this problem is shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/GridWorld.JPG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:200px; height:200px\"/>\n",
    "<center> **A 4x4 Grid World with Terminal State** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid world consists of a 4x4 set of positions the robot can occupy. Each position is considered a state. The goal is to navigate to state 0, the goal, in the minimum steps. We will explore methods to find policies which reach this goal and achieve maximum reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid position 0 is the goal and a **terminal state**. There are no possible state transitions out of this position. The presence of a terminal state makes this an **episodic Markov random process**. For each episode sampled the robot can start in any other random position, $\\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 \\}$. This random selection process makes this a **random start** TD algorithm. The episode terminates when the robot enters the terminal position (state 0).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, an RL agent may need to explore to find the possible actions when it is in some particular state. To simplify our example, we encode, or represent, these possibilities in a dictionary as shown in the code block below. We use a dictionary of dictionaries to perform the lookup. The keys of the outer dictionary are the identifiers (numbers) of the states. The keys of the inner dictionary are the possible actions and the values are the **successor state**, $s'$, for that transition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In each state, there are four possible actions the robot can take:\n",
    "- up, u\n",
    "- down, d,\n",
    "- left, l\n",
    "- right, r\n",
    "\n",
    "The TD RL agent has no model for the environment. Therefore, beyond these allowed actions, all other information is encapsulated in the environment and is unobservable by the agent. This is the key difference between reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. "

    "### Double Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-learning algorithm just presented has a significant **bias**. To understand why this might be consider the following thought experiment. In most cases the sampled action values are inaccurate. Some action values will have a positive error and some will have a negative error. In the error is on the order of the values themselves, the $max_a$ operator has a reasonable chance of selecting an action value that is the largest because of this error. However, the $max_a$ operator will never select an action with a low value simply because of the errors. The net result is a bias toward action values with the largest positive error. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can be done to correct this situation? One relatively simple and effective algorithm is known as **double Q-learning**. Double Q-learning maintains two tables of action values. The values from one table are used to perform the bootstrap updates of the other table and vice versa. This approach averages out the bias. For two tables, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ we can express double Q-learning as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_1(S_t,A_t) = Q_1(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_2(S_{t+1},argmax_a Q_1(S_{t+1}, a) - Q_1(S_t,A_t) \\big] \\\\\n",
    "Q_2(S_t,A_t) = Q_2(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_1(S_{t+1},argmax_a Q_2(S_{t+1}, a) - Q_2(S_t,A_t) \\big]$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "With a 0.5 probability one or the other of these expressions is used for the TD update at each time step. While double Q-learning requires twice as much memory, to maintain the two tables, the computational complexity is the same when compared to Q-learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Another **unbiased** one step off policy TD algorithm is known as **expected SARSA**. See Section 6.6 of Sutton and Barto, second edition, for details.   "

    "\n",
    "For n-step off-policy learning we update a target policy $\\pi(A_t|S_t)$ using samples from a behavior policy $b(A_t|S_t)$. Since the two policies differ, the probabilities of an action given the state will undoubtedly differ. For example, the behavior policy can be exploratory whereas, the target policy is greedy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the different probabilities of sampling we reweight by the **importance sampling ratio**. For an n-step algorithm at time step $t$ the importance sampling ratio can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_{t:t + n -1} = \\prod_{k=\\tau}^{min(t + n -1,T-1)} \\frac{\\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The n-step TD update then becomes:\n",

    "\n",
    "For both of the above update equations consider the effect of importance sampling ratio. If the action given state is more likely under the target policy that the behavior policy, more weight is given to updating with the error term. However, If the action given state is less likely under the target policy that the behavior policy, less weight is given to updating with the error term. In this way, the weighting by the importance sampling ratio gives the correct updates for the target policy regardless of the transition probabilities of the behavior policy. \n",
