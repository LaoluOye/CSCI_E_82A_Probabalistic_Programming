    "In the previous lesson we explored Monte Carlo **reinforcement learning**. MC RL required that the returns for an entire episode be computed before any values are available for use. The disadvantage of this approach is the the full set of returns are required for state value or action value estimates. But, how can we get state values or action-values in fewer time steps? It turns out there are algorithms which compute estimates in as few as one step known as **time difference learning** or **TD-learning** and **Q-learning**. \n",

    "Recall that reinforcement learning has several distinctive characteristics, which differentiate this method from other machine learning and dynamic programming:\n",
    "- **No Markov model** needs to be specified for reinforcement learning, in contrast to dynamic programming.\n",
    "- Like dynamic programming, reinforcement learning **optimizes a reward function**. This is in contrast to supervised and unsupervised learning which use an error or objective function.  \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by **experience**. Over time, the algorithm learns a model of the environment and these results are used to optimize the expected reward. Learning from experience is in contrast to supervised learning which uses known marked cases. \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning agents take **actions** and only receive **state** and **rewards** from the environment. These are the only interaction between the RL agent and the environment.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between a reinforcement learning agent and the environment are illustrated in the figure below. Notice that the only feedback the agent receives from the environment is reward and state.   \n",

    "The ability to learn from experience is an attractive concept. This method of learning seems to mimic human learning. However, reinforcement learning has proven difficult to use in real-world applications. For a review of successes and problems arising when applying RL to robotics see [Kobler et. al.](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Kober_IJRR_2013.pdf). At the present time, RL has mostly succeeded in cases where simulations can be used to gain experience. \n",

    "\n",
    "Following this general formulation the update for TD state value can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(S_t) = V(S_t) + \\alpha \\big[ G_T - V(S_t) \\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,   \n",
    "$\\alpha = $ the learning rate,    \n",
    "$\\big[ G_T - V(S_t) \\big] = $ the error term is the difference between the return $G_t$ and the value, $V(S_t)$. The return is identical to the value at convergence.   \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Using the same general formulation we can create and single time step update model know as the **one step time difference** or **TD(0)** algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Like dynamic programming algorithms, the TD algorithm **bootstraps**. The return and estimated value at the next time step, $V(S_{t+1})$, are from previous samples. However, unlike MC RL which does not bootstrap, the TD(0) algorithm produces an estimate of $V(S_t)$ in only one time step, rather than waiting to reach the terminal state at the end of the episode. This fact can be seen by examining the backup diagram shown below:\n",

    "In each state, there are four possible actions the robot can take:\n",
    "- up, u\n",
    "- down, d,\n",
    "- left, l\n",
    "- right, r\n",
    "\n",
    "The TD RL agent has no model. Therefore, beyond these allowed actions and a list of states visited, all other information is encapsulated in the environment and is unobservable by the agent. This is the key difference between reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RL agent must **explore** to find the possible actions when it is in some particular state. To simplify our example, we encode, or represent, these possibilities in a dictionary as shown in the code block below. The keys of the inner dictionary are the possible actions and the values are the **successor state**, $s'$, for that transition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with MC RL, we can start with an arbitrary initial policy for TD RL. The TD RL agent will then improve this policy and in the process will **learn the Markov process model**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to define the transition probabilities for the initial policy. We set the probabilities for each transition as a **uniform distribution** leading to random action by the robot. As there are 4 possible transitions from each state, this means all transition probabilities are 0.25. In other words, this is a random policy which does not favor any particular plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial uniform transition probabilities are encoded using a dictionary of dictionaries. The organization of this data structure is identical to the foregoing data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The robot receives the following rewards:\n",
    "- 10 for entering position 0. \n",
    "- -1 for attempting to leave the grid. In other words, we penalize the robot for hitting the edges of the grid.  \n",
    "- -0.1 for all other state transitions, which is the cost for the robot to move from one state to another. If we did not have this penalty, the robot could follow any random plan to the goal which did not hit the edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "This **reward structure is unknown to the TD(0) RL agent**. The agent must **learn** the rewards by sampling the environment. Here the rewards are in the form of action values. We encode these rewards in the same type of dictionary structure used for the foregoing structures. "

    "### Double Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-learning algorithm just presented has a significant **bias**. To understand why this might be consider the following thought experiment. In most cases the sampled action values are inaccurate. Some action values will have a positive error and some will have a negative error. In the error is on the order of the values themselves, the $max_a$ operator has a reasonable chance of selecting an action value that is the largest because of this error. However, the $max_a$ operator will never select an action with a low value simply because of the errors. The net result is a bias toward action values with the largest positive error. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can be done to correct this situation? One relatively simple and effective algorithm is known as **double Q-learning**. Double Q-learning maintains two tables of action values. The values from one table are used to perform the bootstrap updates of the other table and vice versa. This approach averages out the bias. For two tables, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ we can express double Q-learning as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_1(S_t,A_t) = Q_1(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_2(S_{t+1},argmax_a Q_1(S_{t+1}, a) - Q_1(S_t,A_t) \\big] \\\\\n",
    "Q_2(S_t,A_t) = Q_2(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_1(S_{t+1},argmax_a Q_2(S_{t+1}, a) - Q_2(S_t,A_t) \\big]$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "With a 0.5 probability one or the other of these expressions is used for the TD update at each time step. While double Q-learning requires twice as much memory, to maintain the two tables, the computational complexity is the same when compared to Q-learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Another **unbiased** one step off policy TD algorithm is known as **expected SARSA**. See Section 6.6 of Sutton and Barto, second edition, for details.   "

In the first part of this lesson we have focused on one-step time differencing, TD, algorithms which update estimates at each time step. Now, we will look at algorithms between these two extreme cases, n-step time differencing algorithms. \n",

    "\n",
    "For n-step off-policy learning we update a target policy $\\pi(A_t|S_t)$ using samples from a behavior policy $b(A_t|S_t)$. Since the two policies differ, the probabilities of an action given the state will undoubtedly differ. For example, the behavior policy can be exploratory whereas, the target policy is greedy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the different probabilities of sampling we reweight by the **importance sampling ratio**. For an n-step algorithm at time step $t$ the importance sampling ratio can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_{t:t + n -1} = \\prod_{k=\\tau}^{min(t + n -1,T-1)} \\frac{\\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "For both of the above update equations consider the effect of importance sampling ratio. If the action given state is more likely under the target policy that the behavior policy, more weight is given to updating with the error term. However, If the action given state is less likely under the target policy that the behavior policy, less weight is given to updating with the error term. In this way, the weighting by the importance sampling ratio gives the correct updates for the target policy regardless of the transition probabilities of the behavior policy. \n",
